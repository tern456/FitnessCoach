This means you would try to walk about " + "\(fitbitData.shared.activeSteps() + 1000)" + " steps every day this upcoming week. It may seem like a lot right now, but remember, 1000 steps can be achieved in a slow to medium paced jog or a brisk walk for about 10 minutes. Do you think you can continue to increase your daily steps average by 1,000 per week."
